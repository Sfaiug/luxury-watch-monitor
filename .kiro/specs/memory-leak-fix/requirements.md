# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The watch monitor application experiences a critical memory leak when running continuously on a VM, causing the system to run out of RAM after approximately one week of operation. This feature addresses the memory leak by identifying and fixing the root causes of unbounded memory growth in the long-running monitoring process.

## Glossary

- **Watch Monitor System**: The Python application that continuously scrapes watch retailer websites and sends Discord notifications for new watches
- **Monitoring Cycle**: A single iteration of scraping all configured watch retailer sites
- **Session History**: JSON file storing historical data about past monitoring cycles
- **Seen Items**: In-memory and persisted set of watch IDs that have been previously detected
- **aiohttp Session**: HTTP client session used for making web requests
- **BeautifulSoup Objects**: HTML parsing objects that can accumulate in memory if not properly released

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the watch monitor to maintain stable memory usage over extended periods, so that the VM does not crash after one week of operation

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Watch Monitor System runs continuously for 7 days, THE Watch Monitor System SHALL maintain memory usage below 500MB
2. WHEN a Monitoring Cycle completes, THE Watch Monitor System SHALL release all temporary objects and close all connections
3. WHILE THE Watch Monitor System is running, THE Watch Monitor System SHALL limit session history file size to prevent unbounded growth
4. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL implement connection pooling limits to prevent connection accumulation
5. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL clear BeautifulSoup objects after each scraping operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify all sources of memory leaks in the codebase, so that I can implement targeted fixes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL limit the session_history.json file to a maximum of 1000 entries
2. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL limit the seen_watches.json file to a maximum of 10,000 items per site
3. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL explicitly close aiohttp ClientSession connections after each use
4. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL clear BeautifulSoup soup objects after parsing
5. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL implement periodic garbage collection to reclaim memory

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring and alerting for memory usage, so that I can detect potential issues before they cause crashes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory usage exceeds 400MB, THE Watch Monitor System SHALL log a warning message
2. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL log current memory usage statistics after each Monitoring Cycle
3. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL include memory usage in session statistics
4. WHERE memory profiling is enabled, THE Watch Monitor System SHALL generate detailed memory reports
5. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL implement a health check endpoint that reports memory usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement best practices for long-running Python applications, so that the system remains stable indefinitely

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL implement explicit resource cleanup in finally blocks
2. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL use context managers for all file operations
3. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL avoid storing large objects in global or instance variables
4. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL implement periodic cleanup of old data files
5. THE Watch Monitor System SHALL use weak references where appropriate to allow garbage collection
